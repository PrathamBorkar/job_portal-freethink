This basically creates a route which fetches resume pdf from the express server by using uid as param
and then uses the resume text to match (for now static) skills and then suggests them to the user so the user can then may be add those to his profile

To run this do these steps:

step 1: python -m venv venv

step 2: venv\Scripts\activate

step 3: pip install -r requirements.txt
